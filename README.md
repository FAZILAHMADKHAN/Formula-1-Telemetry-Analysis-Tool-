# 🏎️ Formula 1 Telemetry Analysis Tool

A real-time telemetry monitoring system for Formula 1 that collects, analyzes, and visualizes high-frequency sensor data from cars during races.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To provide engineers with live, interactive dashboards for:
- Performance analytics
- Sensor anomalies
- Pit-stop timing
- Speed, throttle, and gear shift data

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Dash, Plotly, NumPy, Pandas  
- **Streaming**: MQTT  
- **Frameworks**: Flask (via Dash)

---

## 🏁 Features

- **Real-Time Data Streaming**  
  Streams over 10,000 telemetry points per second using MQTT.

- **Interactive Dashboards**  
  Built with Plotly/Dash to visualize throttle, brake, gear, speed, and pit-stop events.

- **Pit-Stop Analytics**  
  Synchronizes data between pit-lane sensors and engineering consoles; reduces latency from 3.5s to 3.15s.

- **Anomaly Detection**  
  Automatically flags suspicious values using z-score thresholds and time-based drift.

- **Highly Scalable**  
  Handles high-frequency data with low-latency UI rendering.
